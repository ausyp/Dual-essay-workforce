	abstract = {Abstract Aims and objectives The purpose of this study was to explore how undergraduate students perceive and make decisions regarding mental health nursing as a career following completion of an inpatient mental health practicum. Background Among nursing students, mental health is consistently perceived as the least desirable nursing career path. However, evidence to explain why this is the case remains limited, with a lack of research exploring students' experiences of mental health settings and how these experiences influence their perceptions of a mental health nursing career. This knowledge gap limits strategies to support nurses' selection of mental health nursing as a career path, contributing to a global shortage of mental health nurses. Design This study used a qualitative narrative inquiry design. Methods In-depth interviews (N = 15) were conducted with undergraduate nursing students to explore their experiences of mental health practicums. Participants had all completed a 6-week practicum in inpatient mental health settings in urban hospitals. Reporting follows COREQ guidelines. Results Nursing students' decisions to not choose a career in mental health nursing were influenced by negative practicum experiences, including the institutional environments of the inpatient mental health settings and witnessing of harmful nursing practices. These factors were identified as barriers to pursuing a career in mental health nursing. However, students expressed desire to continue to work with clients with mental health challenges and aimed to pursue nursing careers that preserve this opportunity in different healthcare settings. Conclusions These findings expand upon existing literature that frequently positions nursing students as ?uninterested? in mental health nursing and offers insights that can contribute to addressing global mental health nursing shortages. Relevance to clinical practice This study highlights the need for mental health nurses, nursing leaders, and educators to recognise and respond to students' difficult experiences in the inpatient mental health setting during practicums.},

The literature identifies the following issues as problematic: role confusion and role strain; lack of support, training, and supervision structures; job titles that do not reflect actual work; poor and inconsistent pay; overwork; limited professional development; insufficient organizational adaptation to expedite consumer participation; staff discrimination and stigma; dual relationships; and the need to further evaluate consumer workforce contributions. These factors adversely impact on the emotional well-being of the consumer workforce and might deprive them of the support required for the consumer participation roles to impact on service delivery. The attitudes of mental health professionals have been identified as a significant obstacle to the enhancement of consumer participation and consumer workforce roles, particularly in public mental health services. A more comprehensive understanding of consumer workforce roles, their benefits, and the obstacles to their success should become integral to the education and training provided to the mental health nursing workforce of the future to contribute to the development of a more supportive working environment to facilitate the development of effective consumer roles},

This study sought to investigate IDU perspectives regarding the impact of supervised injection facility (SIF) use on access to health-care services. Design and Methods. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 50 Vancouver-based IDU participating in the Scientific Evaluation of Supervised Injecting cohort. Audio-recorded interviews elicited IDU perspectives regarding the impact of SIF use on access to health and social services. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and a thematic analysis was conducted. Results. Fifty IDU, including 21 women, participated in this study. IDU narratives indicate that the SIF serves to facilitate access to health care by providing much-needed care on-site and connects IDU to external services through referrals. Participants’ perspectives suggest that the SIF has facilitated increased uptake of health and social services among IDU. Discussion and Conclusions. Although challenges related to access to care remain in many settings, SIF have potential to promote health by facilitating enhanced access to health-care and social services through a model of care that is accessible to high-risk IDU.[Small W, Van Borek N, Fairbairn N, Wood E, Kerr T.

	abstract = {Objectives
Supervised injection facilities (SIFs) are increasingly being implemented worldwide in response to the harms associated with injection drug use. Although SIFs have been shown to promote engagement of people who use injection drugs (PWID) with external health services, little is known about the potential of co-locating on-site detoxification services with SIFs. The aim of this study was to characterize use of detoxification services co-located at Insite, North America's first SIF, among PWID in Vancouver, Canada.
Methods
Data were derived from two prospective cohorts of PWID in Vancouver, Canada between November 2010 and December 2012. Using multivariable generalized estimating equation logistic regression, we identified factors independently associated with reporting use of detoxification services at the SIF.
Results
Among 1316 PWID, 147 (11.2\%) reported enrolling in detoxification services co-located with the SIF at least once during the two year study period. In multivariable analyses, after adjustment for other potential cofounders, factors independently and positively associated with use of this service included residence{\textless}5 blocks from the SIF (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]=1.70), enrollment in methadone maintenance therapy (AOR=1.90), public injection (AOR=1.53), binge injection (AOR=1.93), recent overdose (AOR=1.90) and frequent SIF use (AOR=8.15) (all p{\textless}0.05).
Discussion
Use of on-site detoxification services offered at the SIF was common among PWID and associated with frequent SIF use and various markers of vulnerability and drug-related risk. These findings highlight the potential role of SIFs as a point of access to detoxification services for high-risk PWID. Future studies should examine if co-location leads to higher uptake of addiction services in comparison to services that create geographic or other obstacles.},

Homelessness among people who inject drugs (PWID) in Australia has been increasing, and establishing how supervised injecting facilities (SIFs) might best support clients into housing is an important goal. The purpose of this paper is to update knowledge regarding the accommodation status of MSIC clients, thereby supporting a better understanding of the complex needs of these clients.,Client accommodation status at MSIC registration (first visit) and in a brief survey (conducted in May 2016) were compared; unstable accommodation was defined as rough sleeping, couch surfing, hostel, boarding house or crisis accommodation. The bivariate logistic regression analysis was used to explore the association between socio-demographics and accommodation status at both time points; a paired t-test was used to compare the visit records for those who reported stable and unstable accommodation in May 2016.,Of 232 clients who were present at MSIC during the week the Brief Survey was conducted, 107 participated. Most were male (79 per cent) with a mean age of 41.4 years. A total of 64 (60 per cent) identified as living in unstable accommodation; having increased from 40 per cent at the time of registration (first visit). There were significant positive associations between unstable accommodation status and unemployment, imprisonment and history of overdose, all measured at registration. In May 2016, unstable accommodation status was significantly associated with age of first injection and with unemployment status (as measured at registration); those living in unstable accommodation in May 2016 had a lower number of visits, a lower number of referrals to health and social services and a lower number of overdoses at MSIC than those living in a stable accommodation.,The rates of unstable accommodation among MSIC clients have been increasing. These findings highlight the importance of SIFs and drug consumption rooms as venue to address the essential needs of PWID, such as housing. The window of opportunity to support PWID who experience housing instability seems to be narrower than for those who live in stable accommodation.},

	abstract = {Individuals living with serious mental illness are often difficult to engage in ongoing treatment, with high dropout rates. Poor engagement may lead to worse clinical outcomes, with symptom relapse and rehospitalization. Numerous variables may affect level of treatment engagement, including therapeutic alliance, accessibility of care, and a client's trust that the treatment will address his/her own unique goals. As such, we have found that the concept of recovery‐oriented care, which prioritizes autonomy, empowerment and respect for the person receiving services, is a helpful framework in which to view tools and techniques to enhance treatment engagement. Specifically, person‐centered care, including shared decision making, is a treatment approach that focuses on an individual's unique goals and life circumstances. Use of person‐centered care in mental health treatment models has promising outcomes for engagement. Particular populations of people have historically been difficult to engage, such as young adults experiencing a first episode of psychosis, individuals with coexisting psychotic and substance use disorders, and those who are homeless. We review these populations and outline how various evidence‐based, recovery‐oriented treatment techniques have been shown to enhance engagement. Our review then turns to emerging treatment strategies that may improve engagement. We focus on use of electronics and Internet, involvement of peer providers in mental health treatment, and incorporation of the Cultural Formulation Interview to provide culturally competent, person‐centered care. Treatment engagement is complex and multifaceted, but optimizing recovery‐oriented skills and attitudes is essential in delivery of services to those with serious mental illness.},

	abstract = {Background
Vancouver, Canada has a pilot supervised injecting facility (SIF), where individuals can inject pre-obtained drugs under the supervision of medical staff. There has been concern that the program may facilitate ongoing drug use and delay entry into addiction treatment.
Methods
We used Cox regression to examine factors associated with the time to the cessation of injecting, for a minimum of 6 months, among a random sample of individuals recruited from within the Vancouver SIF. In further analyses, we evaluated the time to enrolment in addiction treatment.
Results
Between December 2003 and June 2006, 1090 participants were recruited. In Cox regression, factors independently associated with drug use cessation included use of methadone maintenance therapy (Adjusted Hazard Ratio [AHR]=1.57 [95\% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.02–2.40]) and other addiction treatment (AHR=1.85 [95\% CI: 1.06–3.24]). In subsequent analyses, factors independently associated with the initiation of addiction treatment included: regular SIF use at baseline (AHR=1.33 [95\% CI: 1.04–1.72]); having contact with the addiction counselor within the SIF (AHR=1.54 [95\% CI: 1.13–2.08]); and Aboriginal ancestry (AHR=0.66 [95\% CI: 0.47–0.92]).
Conclusions
While the role of addiction treatment in promoting injection cessation has been well described, these data indicate a potential role of SIF in promoting increased uptake of addiction treatment and subsequent injection cessation. The finding that Aboriginal persons were less likely to enroll in addiction treatment is consistent with prior reports and demonstrates the need for novel and culturally appropriate drug treatment approaches for this population.},

	abstract = {Introduction and Aims. Injection drug users (IDU) often experience barriers to conventional health-care services, and consequently might rely on acute and emergency services. This study sought to investigate IDU perspectives regarding the impact of supervised injection facility (SIF) use on access to health-care services. Design and Methods. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 50 Vancouver-based IDU participating in the Scientific Evaluation of Supervised Injecting cohort. Audio-recorded interviews elicited IDU perspectives regarding the impact of SIF use on access to health and social services. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and a thematic analysis was conducted. Results. Fifty IDU, including 21 women, participated in this study. IDU narratives indicate that the SIF serves to facilitate access to health care by providing much-needed care on-site and connects IDU to external services through referrals. Participants’ perspectives suggest that the SIF has facilitated increased uptake of health and social services among IDU. Discussion and Conclusions. Although challenges related to access to care remain in many settings, SIF have potential to promote health by facilitating enhanced access to health-care and social services through a model of care that is accessible to high-risk IDU.[Small W, Van Borek N, Fairbairn N, Wood E, Kerr T.

To evaluate the factors associated with receiving cutaneous injection-related infection (CIRI) care among a representative cohort of supervised injecting facility (SIF) users.
Methods
Data were collected biannually as part of a prospective cohort, the Scientific Evaluation of Supervised Injection study. Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox proportional hazards regression with recurrent events were used to examine incidence and factors associated with CIRI care, respectively.
Results
One thousand eighty individuals were recruited between December 1, 2003 and January 31, 2008. The incidence density of participants receiving CIRI care was 22.0 per 100 person-years (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 19.6–24.6). In the adjusted Cox proportional hazard model, female sex (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR]=1.87 [95\% CI: 1.32–2.64]), unstable housing (AHR=1.39 [95\% CI: 1.02–1.88]), and daily heroin injection (AHR=1.52 [95\% CI: 1.13–2.04]) were independently associated with receiving CIRI care at the SIF.
Conclusions
These results describe who is more likely to receive CIRI care, which is of use to those engaged with policy and practice of treatment regimens involving this population.},

	abstract = {Background
The process of drug injection may give rise to vascular and soft tissue injuries and infections. The social and physical environments in which drugs are injected play a significant role in these and other morbidities. Supervised injecting facilities (SIFs) seek to address such issues associated with public injecting drug use.
Aims
Estimate lifetime prevalence of injecting-related problems, injury and disease and explore the socio-demographic and behavioral characteristics associated with the more serious complications.
Design, Setting, Participants
Self-report data from 9552 injecting drug users (IDUs) registering to use the Sydney Medically Supervised Injecting Centre (MSIC).
Findings
Lifetime history of either injecting-related problems (IRP) or injecting-related injury and disease (IRID) was reported by 29\% of the 9552 IDUs; 26\% (n=2469) reported ever experiencing IRP and 10\% (n=972) reported IRID. Prevalence of IRP included difficulties finding a vein (18\%), prominent scarring or bruising (14\%) and swelling of hands or feet (7\%). Prevalence of IRID included abscesses or skin infection (6\%), thrombosis (4\%), septicaemia (2\%) and endocarditis (1\%). Females, those who mainly injected drugs other than heroin, and those who reported a history of drug treatment, drug overdose, and/or sex work, were more likely to report lifetime IRID. Frequency and duration of injecting, recent public injecting, and sharing of needles and/or syringes were also independently associated with IRID.
Conclusions
IRPs and IRIDs were common. Findings support the imperative for education and prevention activities to reduce the severity and burden of these preventable injecting outcomes. Through provision of hygienic environments and advice on venous access, safer injecting techniques and wound care, SIFs have the potential to address a number of risk factors for IRID.},

	abstract = {Background
Overdose from illicit drugs is a leading cause of premature mortality in North America. Internationally, more than 65 supervised injecting facilities (SIFs), where drug users can inject pre-obtained illicit drugs, have been opened as part of various strategies to reduce the harms associated with drug use. We sought to determine whether the opening of an SIF in Vancouver, BC, Canada, was associated with a reduction in overdose mortality.
Methods
We examined population-based overdose mortality rates for the period before (Jan 1, 2001, to Sept 20, 2003) and after (Sept 21, 2003, to Dec 31, 2005) the opening of the Vancouver SIF. The location of death was determined from provincial coroner records. We compared overdose fatality rates within an a priori specified 500 m radius of the SIF and for the rest of the city.
Findings
Of 290 decedents, 229 (79·0\%) were male, and the median age at death was 40 years (IQR 32–48 years). A third (89, 30·7\%) of deaths occurred in city blocks within 500 m of the SIF. The fatal overdose rate in this area decreased by 35·0\% after the opening of the SIF, from 253·8 to 165·1 deaths per 100 000 person-years (p=0·048). By contrast, during the same period, the fatal overdose rate in the rest of the city decreased by only 9·3\%, from 7·6 to 6·9 deaths per 100 000 person-years (p=0·490). There was a significant interaction of rate differences across strata (p=0·049).
Interpretation
SIFs should be considered where injection drug use is prevalent, particularly in areas with high densities of overdose.

	abstract = {Aims Supervised injecting facilities (SIFs) are effective in reducing the harms associated with injecting drug use among their clientele, but do SIFs ease the burden on ambulance services of attending to overdoses in the community? This study addresses this question, which is yet to be answered, in the growing body of international evidence supporting SIFs efficacy. Design Ecological study of patterns in ambulance attendances at opioid-related overdoses, before and after the opening of a SIF in Sydney, Australia. Setting A SIF opened as a pilot in Sydney's ‘red light’ district with the aim of accommodating a high throughput of injecting drug users (IDUs) for supervised injecting episodes, recovery and the management of overdoses. Measurements A total of 20 409 ambulance attendances at opioid-related overdoses before and after the opening of the Sydney SIF. Average monthly ambulance attendances at suspected opioid-related overdoses, before (36 months) and after (60 months) the opening of the Sydney Medically Supervised Injecting Centre (MSIC), in the vicinity of the centre and in the rest of New South Wales (NSW). Results The burden on ambulance services of attending to opioid-related overdoses declined significantly in the vicinity of the Sydney SIF after it opened, compared to the rest of NSW. This effect was greatest during operating hours and in the immediate MSIC area, suggesting that SIFs may be most effective in reducing the impact of opioid-related overdose in their immediate vicinity. Conclusions By providing environments in which IDUs receive supervised injection and overdose management and education SIF can reduce the demand for ambulance services, thereby freeing them to attend other medical emergencies within the community.},

	abstract = {Background No systematic attempts have been made to estimate the global and regional prevalence of amphetamine, cannabis, cocaine, and opioid dependence, and quantify their burden. We aimed to assess the prevalence and burden of drug dependence, as measured in years of life lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Methods We conducted systematic reviews of the epidemiology of drug dependence, and analysed results with Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2010 (GBD 2010) Bayesian meta-regression technique (DisMod-MR) to estimate population-level prevalence of dependence and use. GBD 2010 calculated new disability weights by use of representative community surveys and an internet-based survey. We combined estimates of dependence with disability weights to calculate prevalent YLDs, YLLs, and DALYs, and estimated YLDs, YLLs, and DALYs attributable to drug use as a risk factor for other health outcomes. Findings Illicit drug dependence directly accounted for 20·0 million DALYs (95\% UI 15·3-25·4 million) in 2010, accounting for 0·8\% (0·6-1·0) of global all-cause DALYs. Worldwide, more people were dependent on opioids and amphetamines than other drugs. Opioid dependence was the largest contributor to the direct burden of DALYs (9·2 million, 95\% UI 7·1-11·4). The proportion of all-cause DALYs attributed to drug dependence was 20 times higher in some regions than others, with an increased proportion of burden in countries with the highest incomes. Injecting drug use as a risk factor for HIV accounted for 2·1 million DALYs (95\% UI 1·1-3·6 million) and as a risk factor for hepatitis C accounted for 502 000 DALYs (286 000-891 000). Suicide as a risk of amphetamine dependence accounted for 854 000 DALYs (291 000-1 791 000), as a risk of opioid dependence for 671 000 DALYs (329 000-1 730 000), and as a risk of cocaine dependence for 324 000 DALYs (109 000-682 000). Countries with the highest rate of burden ({\textgreater}650 DALYs per 100 000 population) included the USA, UK, Russia, and Australia. Interpretation Illicit drug use is an important contributor to the global burden of disease. Efficient strategies to reduce disease burden of opioid dependence and injecting drug use, such as delivery of opioid substitution treatment and needle and syringe programmes, are needed to reduce this burden at a population scale.

	abstract = {Background: Vancouver, Canada has a pilot supervised injecting facility (SIF), where individuals can inject pre-obtained drugs under the supervision of medical staff. There has been concern that the program may facilitate ongoing drug use and delay entry into addiction treatment. Methods: We used Cox regression to examine factors associated with the time to the cessation of injecting, for a minimum of 6 months, among a random sample of individuals recruited from within the Vancouver SIF. In further analyses, we evaluated the time to enrolment in addiction treatment. Results: Between December 2003 and June 2006, 1090 participants were recruited. In Cox regression, factors independently associated with drug use cessation included use of methadone maintenance therapy (Adjusted Hazard Ratio [AHR] = 1.57 [95\% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.02-2.40]) and other addiction treatment (AHR = 1.85 [95\% CI: 1.06-3.24]). In subsequent analyses, factors independently associated with the initiation of addiction treatment included: regular SIF use at baseline (AHR = 1.33 [95\% CI: 1.04-1.72]); having contact with the addiction counselor within the SIF (AHR = 1.54 [95\% CI: 1.13-2.08]); and Aboriginal ancestry (AHR = 0.66 [95\% CI: 0.47-0.92]). Conclusions: While the role of addiction treatment in promoting injection cessation has been well described, these data indicate a potential role of SIF in promoting increased uptake of addiction treatment and subsequent injection cessation. The finding that Aboriginal persons were less likely to enroll in addiction treatment is consistent with prior reports and demonstrates the need for novel and culturally appropriate drug treatment approaches for this population. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

	abstract = {Introduction and Aims. Researchers are often frustrated by their inability to influence policy.We describe models of policy-making to provide new insights and a more realistic assessment of research impacts on policy. Design and Methods. We describe five prominent models of policy-making and illustrate them with examples from the alcohol and drugs field, before drawing lessons for researchers. Results. Policy-making is a complex and messy process, with different models describing different elements.We start with the incrementalist model,which highlights small amendments to policy, as occurs in school-based drug education.A technical/rational approach then outlines the key steps in a policy process from identification of problems and their causes, through to examination and choice of response options, and subsequent implementation and evaluation.There is a clear role for research, as we illustrate with the introduction of new medications, but this model largely ignores the dominant political aspects of policy-making. Such political aspects include the influence of interest groups, and we describe models about power and pressure groups, as well as advocacy coalitions, and the challenges they pose for researchers.These are illustrated with reference to the alcohol industry, and interest group conflicts in establishing a Medically Supervised Injecting Centre. Finally, we describe the multiple streams framework, which alerts researchers to 'windows of opportunity', and we show how these were effectively exploited in policy for cannabis law reform inWestern Australia.

Understanding models of policy-making can help researchers maximise the uptake of their work and advance evidence-informed policy. © 2010 Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other Drugs.},

	abstract = {Introduction and Aims. Uptake of treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among people who inject drugs is low. Further understanding is required of the relationship between HCV knowledge and treatment willingness, assessment and treatment in this population. Design and Methods. A cross-sectional self-administered survey was conducted with clients of four opioid substitution therapy (OST) clinics and the Medically Supervised Injecting Centre in Sydney, Australia. Results. Of 132 participants, 85 (64\%) self-reported having HCV infection. HCV knowledge was mixed (mean 6.5, range 0-12) and was relatively lower on items measuring knowledge of factors impacting HCV-related disease progression. The likelihood of being in a higher knowledge category was associated with being female [adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=3.78, 95\% confidence interval (CI) (1.79, 7.98)], higher formal education [AOR=3.28, 95\% CI (1.57, 6.88)], being on a current OST program [AOR=2.61, 95\% CI (1.10, 6.19)] and being older [AOR=1.04, 95\% CI (1.01, 1.09)]. Participants receiving OST were more likely to report higher willingness to have HCV treatment [OR=4.45, 95\% CI (2.23, 8.17)]. Having been assessed for HCV treatment was associated with younger age [AOR=0.93; CI 95\% (0.88, 1.00)] and higher formal education [AOR=7.81; 95\% CI (1.62, 37.71)]. Discussion and Conclusions. Overall, knowledge scores were mid-range. Knowledge of modifiable factors influencing HCV-related liver disease progression was particularly low indicating the need for ongoing education. Education should also be targeted at older people and those not on OST, and be inclusive of those with lower literacy levels.[Treloar C, Hull P, Dore GJ, Grebely J.

	abstract = {Purpose Supervised injecting facilities (SIFs) provide a sanctioned space for injection drug users and are associated with decreased overdose mortality and HIV risk behaviors among adults. Little is known about SIF use among youth. We identified factors associated with use of the Vancouver SIF, the only such facility in North America, among street youth.
Methods From September 2005 to May 2012, we collected data from the At-Risk Youth Study, a prospective cohort of street youth in Vancouver, BC, Canada. Eligible youth were aged 14-26 years. Participants reporting injection completed questionnaires at baseline and semiannually. We used generalized estimating equation logistic regression to identify factors associated with SIF use.
Results During the study period, 42.3\% of 414 injecting youth reported use of the SIF at least once. Of all SIF-using youth, 51.4\% went to the facility at least weekly, and 44.5\% used it for at least one-quarter of all injections. SIF-using youth were more likely to live or spend time in the neighborhood surrounding the SIF (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 3.29; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 2.38-4.54), to inject in public (AOR, 2.08; 95\% CI, 1.53-2.84), or to engage in daily injection of heroin (AOR, 2.36; 95\% CI, 1.72-3.24), cocaine (AOR, 2.44; 95\% CI, 1.34-4.45), or crystal methamphetamine (AOR, 1.62; 95\% CI, 1.13-2.31).

	abstract = {Background: The aim of this study was to assess factors associated with baseline knowledge of HCV and liver disease, acceptability of transient elastography (TE) assessment (FibroScan®), and willingness and intent to receive HCV treatment among persons with a history of injection drug use participating in a liver health promotion campaign. Methods: The LiveRLife campaign involved three phases: (1) campaign resource development; (2) campaign resource testing; and (3) campaign implementation. Participants were enrolled in an observational cohort study with recruitment at four clinics - one primary health care facility, two OST clinics, and one medically supervised injecting centre - in Australia between May and October 2014. Participants received educational material, nurse clinical assessment, TE assessment, dried blood spot testing, and completed a knowledge survey. Results: Of 253 participants (mean age 43 years), 68\% were male, 71\% had injected in the past month, and 75\% self-reported as HCV positive. Median knowledge score was 16/23. In adjusted analysis, less than daily injection (AOR 5.01; 95\% CI, 2.64-9.51) and no daily injection in the past month (AOR 3.54; 95\% CI, 1.80-6.94) were associated with high knowledge (≥16). TE was the most preferred method both pre- (66\%) and post-TE (89\%) compared to liver biopsy and blood sample. Eighty-eight percent were 'definitely willing' or 'somewhat willing' to receive HCV treatment, and 56\% intended to start treatment in the next 12 months. Approximately 68\% had no/mild fibrosis (F0/F1, ≥2.5 to ≤ 7.4. kPa), 13\% moderate fibrosis (F2, ≥ 7.5 to ≤ 9.4. kPa), 10\% severe fibrosis (F3, ≥ 9.5 to ≤ 12.4. kPa), and 9\% had cirrhosis (F4, ≥ 12.5. kPa). Conclusion: Liver disease and HCV knowledge was moderate. High acceptability of TE by PWID provides strong evidence for the inclusion of TE in HCV-related care, and could help to prioritise HCV treatment for those at greatest risk of liver disease progression. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

We describe early findings from an Australian study examining the potential impact of the April 2014 introduction of an abuse-deterrent sustained-release oxycodone formulation (Reformulated OxyContin®). Methods: Data on pharmaceutical opioid sales; drug use by people who inject drugs regularly (PWID); client visits to the Sydney Medically Supervised Injecting Centre (MSIC); and last drug injected by clients of inner-Sydney needle-syringe programmes (NSPs) were obtained, 2009-2014. A cohort of n= 606 people tampering with pharmaceutical opioids was formed pre-April 2014, and followed up May-August 2014. Results: There were declines in pharmacy sales of 80mg OxyContin® post-introduction of the reformulated product, the dose most commonly diverted and injected by PWID. Reformulated OxyContin® was among the least commonly used and injected drugs among PWID. This was supported by Sydney NSP data. There was a dramatic reduction in MSIC visits for injection of OxyContin® post-introduction of the new formulation (from 62\% of monthly visits pre-introduction to 5\% of visits, August 2014). The NOMAD cohort confirmed a reduction in OxyContin® use/injection post-introduction. Reformulated OxyContin® was cheaper and less attractive for tampering than Original OxyContin®. Conclusions: These data suggest that, in the short term, introduction of an abuse-deterrent formulation of OxyContin® in Australia was associated with a reduction in injection of OxyContin®, with no clear switch to other drugs. Reformulated OxyContin®, in this short follow-up, does not appear to be considered as attractive for tampering. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

The Uniting Church justified this overt act of civil disobedience against the State's prohibitionist model of drug usage by invoking the ancient right of sanctuary. This invocation sought to produce a specific sort of spatialisation wherein the meaning of the line constituting sanctuary effects a protected ‘inside’ governed by God's word – civitas dei – ‘outside’ the jurisdiction of state power in civitas terrena. Sanctuary claims a territory exempt from other jurisdictions. The modern assertion of sanctuary enacts in physical space the relationship between state and religious authorities and the integration and intersections of civitas terrena and civitas dei. This article draws upon conceptions of sanctuary at the intersection of the Catholic Christianity tradition and the State since medieval times to analyse the contemporary space of sanctuary in the MSIC, exploring the shifting and ambiguous boundaries in material, legislative, and symbolic spaces. We argue that even though the MSIC has now been incorporated into civitas terrena, it remains and enacts a space of sanctuary. © 2015 Institute of Australian Geographers},

The majority of clients have low levels of education and employment, high rates of incarceration and unstable housing and poor social networks, and 70 \% do not access local health services. These factors increase the risk of poor mental health, and it has been documented that PWID have elevated rates of mood, anxiety, personality and psychotic disorders; post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); and higher rates of trauma exposure, suicidality and self-harm. The current study is the first to investigate the mental health among clients of a SIF. Validated instruments to examine clients' mental health, social networks and trauma histories were administered to 50 frequently attending clients by a mental health nurse. The majority of respondents were unemployed, homeless and had a history of incarceration, and 82 \% report they had been diagnosed with a mental health problem, but only 24 \% report they were receiving treatment. Respondents had poor social networks, had poorer mental health symptoms compared to US inpatients and had experienced multiple traumatic events, and a high number of respondents had scores indicative of PTSD. These results highlight the need for mental health clinicians to be employed in SIFs and other drug consumption rooms (DCRs) to assist clients to address their mental health and psychosocial needs, particularly in light of the fact that these services are often the only places these PWID engage with in an ongoing way. © 2016 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background Fentanyl is a powerful analgesic, the prescription of which has increased markedly in recent years. The emergence of the drug at the Sydney Medically Supervised Injecting Centre (MSIC) warranted a retrospective clinical audit to assess the risk of fentanyl overdose in comparison with other opioids, in the context of a drug consumption room. Method Heroin, fentanyl or other prescription opioids (PO) injections resulting in overdose were audited (September 1, 2012 and August 31, 2015). Rates of overdose per 1000 injections and relative risks (RR) of overdose were calculated. Results In the audit period 189,203 injections by 4177 individuals occurred, with fentanyl injections increasing by 1000\%, heroin injections increasing by 70\% and, inversely, a sharp decline in other PO injections. Fentanyl injections had approximately four and half times the risk of resulting in overdose than heroin or other PO injections combined (RR = 4.6); and, had two times the risk of heroin injections, and eight times the risk of resulting in overdose than other PO injections (RR = 2.2 and RR = 7.9). Conclusion Findings from a drug consumption room, such as the Sydney MSIC can effectively inform harm reduction services and emergency services of the increased use of, and therefore risk of, fentanyl overdose relative to other opioids. The dynamic nature of drug markets mean that services such as MSIC are uniquely placed to provide not only real-time data on drug use trends, but also safer injecting advice to those engaging in new practices. © 2016},

The current study aimed to compare rates per 1000 injections of non-fatal overdose after heroin or oxycodone injection, and their comparative clinical severity. Methods Analysis of prospectively collected data from the Sydney Medically Supervised Injecting Centre (MSIC). Severity of overdose was measured using the Glasgow Coma Scale, oxygen saturation levels, and the administration of naloxone. Results Heroin overdoses occurred at three times the rate of oxycodone overdoses (12.7 v 4.1 per 1000 injections). Heroin overdoses appeared to be more severe than oxycodone overdoses, with higher levels of compromised consciousness (31 v 18\%) and severe respiratory depression (67 v 48\%), but there were no differences in naloxone doses (20 v 17\%). Concurrent use of other depressants at the time of overdose was also associated with compromised consciousness, and the need for naloxone. Conclusions Heroin overdoses occurred at a greater rate than oxycodone overdoses, and had more severe clinical indicators. © 2017},

	doi = {10.1108/DAT-06-2017-0026},
	abstract = {Purpose: The Uniting Medically Supervised Injecting Centre (MSIC) opened in Sydney, Australia, in May 2001. Homelessness among people who inject drugs (PWID) in Australia has been increasing, and establishing how supervised injecting facilities (SIFs) might best support clients into housing is an important goal. The purpose of this paper is to update knowledge regarding the accommodation status of MSIC clients, thereby supporting a better understanding of the complex needs of these clients. Design/methodology/approach: Client accommodation status at MSIC registration (first visit) and in a brief survey (conducted in May 2016) were compared; unstable accommodation was defined as rough sleeping, couch surfing, hostel, boarding house or crisis accommodation. The bivariate logistic regression analysis was used to explore the association between socio-demographics and accommodation status at both time points; a paired t-test was used to compare the visit records for those who reported stable and unstable accommodation in May 2016. Findings: Of 232 clients who were present at MSIC during the week the Brief Survey was conducted, 107 participated. Most were male (79 per cent) with a mean age of 41.4 years. A total of 64 (60 per cent) identified as living in unstable accommodation; having increased from 40 per cent at the time of registration (first visit). There were significant positive associations between unstable accommodation status and unemployment, imprisonment and history of overdose, all measured at registration. In May 2016, unstable accommodation status was significantly associated with age of first injection and with unemployment status (as measured at registration); those living in unstable accommodation in May 2016 had a lower number of visits, a lower number of referrals to health and social services and a lower number of overdoses at MSIC than those living in a stable accommodation. Originality/value: The rates of unstable accommodation among MSIC clients have been increasing. These findings highlight the importance of SIFs and drug consumption rooms as venue to address the essential needs of PWID, such as housing. The window of opportunity to support PWID who experience housing instability seems to be narrower than for those who live in stable accommodation. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Background An open cohort study (LiveRLife) evaluating an intervention integrating non-invasive liver disease assessment via transient elastography (TE) among people who inject drugs (PWID) was conducted in New South Wales, Australia. Participant follow-up occurred 2–16 weeks post-enrolment. It is imperative that PWID understand liver assessment results in order to make informed decisions about their health. The aim of this study was to evaluate the decisions and experiences of participants who received a liver disease assessment, including interpretation of TE score and subsequent health behaviours, using a health literacy framework. Methods Participants who had participated in LiveRLife were recruited from two opioid substitution treatment clinics and one medically supervised injecting centre between November 2015 and February 2016. The four recruitment categories were: (a) high TE score (≥9.5 kPa)/attended follow-up, n = 12; (b) high score/did not attend follow-up, n = 2; (c) low score ({\textless}9.5 kPa)/attended follow-up, n = 11; and (d) low score/did not attend follow-up, n = 8. Participants were not reminded of their category during recruitment. Inclusion criteria were: participants who received a TE score and informed consent. Results Of 33 semi-structured interviews, reasons for receiving a TE assessment were varied. Most participants interpreted level of liver disease correctly based on their TE score. Participants with higher TE scores frequently described feeling surprised by their result and also, often incorrectly identified drug use as a cause of advanced liver disease. In contrast, persons with lower TE scores felt encouraged by their result and spoke more to maintenance of healthy behaviours. When applicable, participants spoke of HCV therapy. Conclusion Findings highlight some positive health changes made by PWID following liver disease assessment as well as ongoing misunderstandings of chronic liver disease in relation to illicit drug use. Results will inform strategies for targeted liver health education and ‘linkage to care’ for PWID with, and at-risk of, advanced liver disease. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Introduction and Aims. Injection of pharmaceutical opioids (PO) among people who inject drugs has increased in many countries. The common method for preparing PO tablets for injection uses heat, resulting in greater particulate matter and therefore increased risk of local infection risk and damage to veins and organs. A cold preparation process has fewer risks, but this preparation method is not commonly used. This study seeks to explore how people who inject PO learn to prepare injections and how health promotion efforts could influence practice. Design and Methods. Between March and December 2013, qualitative interviews were undertaken with 33 clients of Sydney's Medically Supervised Injecting Centre who inject PO tablets regarding sources of knowledge and current preparation methods for injection of POs. Results. Overwhelmingly, the most commonly reported source of knowledge around injection of tablets was others who inject. Most participants reported heating the solution as the quickest way to administer the drug. Attitudes to the use of wheel filters varied, with some participants reporting that they would use the filters if they were shown how, while others reported a number of barriers to using filters, including complexity of use. Discussion and Conclusions. Harnessing the power of social connections may provide avenues for education about safer injecting of tablets, including the use of wheel filters. Further work is required to debunk myths about the relative potencies of cold versus hot drug solution. Collaborations between harm reduction workers and peer workers would assist in knowledge dissemination regarding safer injecting practices. © 2017 Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other Drugs},

	abstract = {Background Oxycodone is implicated in a large number of overdose deaths, many involving intravenous administration of preparations designed for oral administration. International responses have included education strategies, regulatory changes, and tamper-resistant preparations to discourage injecting. Reformulated OxyContin ® was introduced in Australia in April 2014 and this study examines its impact on service utilisation, defined as visits to inject drugs at the Sydney Medically Supervised Injecting Centre (MSIC) and opioid overdoses at the MSIC. Methods Data from February 2007 to February 2016 are presented for drug type injected and onsite opioid overdose. The reformulated OxyContin ® effect was modelled using an interrupted time series approach. Results Client visits declined \&gt;1000 per month, or 18\%, following reformulation, largely explained by a reduction in visits to inject oxycodone, partially offset by increased morphine or fentanyl injections. Despite this significant reduction in visits, there was no corresponding decrease in the number of overdoses managed, explained somewhat by a partial displacement from oxycodone to other opioids. Stable overdose numbers within the context of decreased visit numbers were consistent with increases in heroin and morphine overdose, with an extra 22 heroin and 12 morphine overdoses on average per month. This increase was offset by the decrease of 17 OxyContin ® , overdoses per month. Conclusions This study replicates the trend towards substitution of OxyContin ® with other opioids following the introduction of reformulated OxyContin ® in Australia and extends initial findings by showing the rate of overdose per MSIC visit increased following reformulation. These unintended consequences need to be considered when evaluating the success or otherwise of these kinds of changes in product formulation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

Using data from the Uniting Medically Supervised Injecting Center (MSIC) in Sydney, this study aimed to assess the overdose risk associated with the use of buprenorphine and BNX and identify factors associated with injecting. Methods: Client data routinely collected from MSIC, a drug consumption room where clients can legally inject drugs under supervision, was used. Odds ratios (OR) to assess the risk of overdose and their associated 95\% confidence intervals (95\%CI) were calculated and compared to other substances. Univariate analysis using χ-square and multivariate logistic regressions were used to determine characteristics associated with buprenorphine and BNX injection. Results: Data from 1,020,782 injections by 15,832 individuals were analyzed. Risk of overdose was low for buprenorphine compared to other substances (OR 0.16; 95\%CI: 0.07–0.19) and no overdoses occurred when BNX was injected. Injection of both buprenorphine and BNX was associated with male gender, homelessness, no income/reliance upon government payments, and prior imprisonment. Conclusions: Buprenorphine and BNX continue to be injected, albeit in small numbers. This is the first study to report on injection and overdose risk using direct observation, and has confirmed the lower overdose risk.

	abstract = {Background: Medically Supervised Injection Centres (MSICs) are legally-sanctioned facilities where users can consume pre-obtained drugs under medical supervision. Although there is a substantial body of research exploring their effectiveness, there have been few attempts to quantify outcomes across studies. In order to determine the impact of the body of research as a whole, outcomes from studies were synthesised using meta-analysis. Methods: Literature sources were identified through searches in four bibliographic databases. Inclusion in the final review was dependent on the study meeting certain eligibility criteria, including a minimum of pre-test, post-test, control group designs. Data were extracted and pooled in a meta-analysis using both fixed and random effects methods. Results: Eight studies met the inclusion criteria. Overall, MSICs had a significant, but small, positive effect on outcomes based on the fixed effect analysis and no effect based on random effect analysis. The results of the independent outcome analyses showed that MSICs had a significant favourable result in relation to drug-related crime and a significant unfavourable result in relation to problematic heroin use or injection. MSICs were found to have no effect on overdose mortality or syringe/equipment sharing. Conclusion: Whilst the effectiveness of the early versions of MSICs remains uncertain, this should not rule out continuing to test and develop MSICs in locations where public injecting and other drug-related harms are a major problem. It is important, however, that evaluation research publishes replicable data to enable future meta-analyses and to expand the body of knowledge in the field. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	doi = {10.1111/dar.12864},
	abstract = {Introduction and Aims: North America has witnessed a dramatic rise in fatal opioid overdoses due to the unwitting consumption of non-pharmaceutical fentanyl and its analogues. While some of the drivers of this crisis—including profitability and access to high-potency opioids through internet sources—also apply in Australia, to our knowledge, there have been no ongoing surveillance studies of local populations. Therefore, this pilot study aimed to detect unintentional fentanyl consumption among people who inject heroin through instant urine screening, and determine the feasibility and acceptability of voluntary urinalysis of clients at the Medically Supervised Injecting Centre, Kings Cross, Sydney. Design and Methods: Brief surveys and urine drug screens were conducted with 67 participants in Wave 1 (October 2017) and 51 participants in Wave 2 (March 2018). Urine samples were tested with BTNX Rapid Response™ fentanyl urine strip test at a detection level of 20 ng/mL norfentanyl. These strips also cross-react to numerous fentanyl analogues. Results: There were no cases where positive urine tests suggested unwitting fentanyl use detected in this study. Discussion and Conclusions: These negative findings contrast sharply with similar Canadian studies. While no cases of fentanyl-laced heroin use have been detected so far, we have demonstrated that this surveillance design is low-cost, feasible and scalable approach to monitoring the considerable public-health threat of undetected fentanyl and its analogues in Australia. Further validation of cross-reactivity of test strips would strengthen this method. © 2018 Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other Drugs},

	abstract = {Summary. von Willebrand disease (VWD) is a bleeding disorder caused by inherited defects in the concentration, structure, or function of von Willebrand factor (VWF). VWD is classified into three primary categories. Type 1 includes partial quantitative deficiency, type 2 includes qualitative defects, and type 3 includes virtually complete deficiency of VWF. VWD type 2 is divided into four secondary categories. Type 2A includes variants with decreased platelet adhesion caused by selective deficiency of high-molecular-weight VWF multimers. Type 2B includes variants with increased affinity for platelet glycoprotein Ib. Type 2M includes variants with markedly defective platelet adhesion despite a relatively normal size distribution of VWF multimers. Type 2N includes variants with markedly decreased affinity for factor VIII. These six categories of VWD correlate with important clinical features and therapeutic requirements. Some VWF gene mutations, alone or in combination, have complex effects and give rise to mixed VWD phenotypes. Certain VWD types, especially type 1 and type 2A, encompass several pathophysiologic mechanisms that sometimes can be distinguished by appropriate laboratory studies. The clinical significance of this heterogeneity is under investigation, which may support further subdivision of VWD type 1 or type 2A in the future.},

	abstract = {This paper studies the trade of China in the past 150 years, starting from the first opening of China after the Opium War. The main purpose of the paper is to identify what is (and was) China’s ‘normal’ level of foreign trade, and how these levels changed under different trade regimes, from 1840 to the present. We present new evidence on China’s foreign trade during the treaty port era (1842–1948), drawn from disaggregated trade data collected by the Chinese Maritime Customs Service, that yields important findings for current research. First, although the volume of foreign trade remained limited initially, there was a notable expansion in the diversity of products, with many new goods being imported into China. Second, the regional diffusion of foreign goods through China was greatly facilitated by the expansions of the port system. Third, the importance of Hong Kong as an intermediary in China’s trade has undergone long-term fluctuations suggestive of learning effects. China’s recent wave of liberalization has led by the early 1990s to a trade level comparable to the high of the 1920s. While much of China’s recent growth in world trade is in line with her income growth, there is no doubt that China’s trade openness today, comparable by some measures to Denmark’s, is a stunning reversal relative to the pre-1978 and also the pre-1840 period. The paper emphasises the roles that history and institutional change have played in this.},

	abstract = {Background
This study investigates whether the type, nature or amount of polysubstance use can explain the increased risk of non-fatal overdose among people who inject drugs with severe psychological distress.
Methods
Data came from three years (2011–2013) of the Illicit Drug Reporting System (IDRS), an annual sentinel sample of injecting drug users across Australia (n=2673). Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was used on 14 drug types to construct five latent factors, each representing a type of polysubstance use. Tests of measurement invariance were carried out to determine if polysubstance use profiles differed between those with and without severe psychological distress. Next, we regressed non-fatal overdose on the polysubstance use factors with differences in the relationships tested between groups.
Findings
Among those with severe psychological distress a polysubstance use profile characterised by heroin, oxycodone, crystal methamphetamine and cocaine use was associated with greater risk of non-fatal overdose. Among those without severe psychological distress, two polysubstance use profiles, largely characterised by opioid substitution therapies and prescription drugs, were protective against non-fatal overdose.
Conclusion
The types of polysubstance use profiles did not differ between people who inject drugs with and without severe psychological distress. However, the nature of use of one particular polysubstance profile placed the former group at a strongly increased risk of non-fatal overdose, while the nature of polysubstance use involving opioid substitution therapies was protective only among the latter group. The findings identify polysubstance use profiles of importance to drug-related harms among individuals with psychological problems.},

	abstract = {Background Diagnosing blood-borne virus (BBV) infection is an essential first step in eliminating transmission and securing access to treatment amongst substance misusers. Aims To determine the proportion of substance misusers presenting to hospital who undergo BBV testing and the factors influencing testing. Methods A retrospective cross-sectional study was performed of patients presenting to two Sydney teaching hospitals with substance misuse diagnoses between January and April 2015. Proportions tested for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C and hepatitis B previously and during the index hospitalisation presentation were examined. Multivariable analysis was performed to determine factors associated with testing. Results Of 239 patients, 47 (19.7\%) had a documented BBV at baseline. Of those with unknown BBV status, 29 (12.8\%) had undergone some attempt at testing during presentation; 3.1\% had their hepatitis B immunity assessed. Factors associated with an increased likelihood of testing during presentation included documented injecting drug use (odds ratio (OR) 15.14; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 4.21–54.50; P {\textless} 0.001), admission under a physician (OR 11.79; 95\% CI 2.82–49.40; P = 0.001) and admission on a Friday (OR 4.46; 95\% CI 1.28–15.48; P = 0.02). Patients who had had more than one previous admission in the preceding 6 months (OR 0.24; 95\% CI 0.078–0.73; P = 0.01) or a length of stay of 1 day or less (OR 0.17; 95\% CI 0.032–0.87; P = 0.033) were less likely to be tested. Conclusion Despite the high baseline prevalence of BBV infections in the population, there were many missed opportunities for BBV testing. We found patient-, admission- and clinician-level barriers that could be addressed to enhance BBV testing uptake.},

They affect health indirectly by shaping individual drug-use behavior; they affect health directly by affecting the availability of resources, access to social welfare systems, marginalization, and compliance with medication. Minority groups experience a disproportionately high level of the social factors that adversely affect health, factors that contribute to disparities in health among drug users. Conclusion: Public health interventions aimed at improving the health of drug users must address the social factors that accompany and exacerbate the health consequences of illicit drug use.},

These two values appear to be inextricably linked. Aristotle's doctrine of the mean enables nurses to reflect on the appropriate degree of respect for the dignity of others and of respect for themselves. To develop an understanding of the rationale for and the significance and implications of dignity in health care practice, a view of human nature is proposed that implies vulnerability and fallibility, and that urges that an ethic of aspiration is embraced.

We also propose much-needed clinical avenues to reduce dehumanization in clinical contexts, centrally by (1) improving dehumanization awareness among medical workers; (2) reducing the need for healthcare workers to use dehumanization to alleviate professional exhaustion; and (3) optimizing medical training to increase empathy toward patients.

	abstract = {Patient satisfaction surveys are seen as an important way of obtaining 'user views' of health service provision. However, there is a growing body of research and theoretical literature that questions the validity of the concept of 'patient satisfaction' and hence the use of this type of survey. A postbereavement survey of people who registered a random sample of cancer deaths in an inner London health authority was undertaken in 1996/7. The survey questionnaire (VOICES) included 14 open-ended questions which asked respondents to add any comments they felt were relevant about the care of the deceased. This paper uses these data to examine the causes of dissatisfaction with hospital-based care. Of the 229 informants responding to the questionnaire, 138 included some written comment about care in hospital. At least one negative comment was made by 59\% (82) of those making any comment. Of these, 55\% (44) rated the care given by doctors as 'excellent' or 'good' and 63\% (50) rated that given by nurses as 'excellent' or 'good'. Qualitative analysis of responses to open questions suggest that expressions of dissatisfaction arise from a sense of being 'devalued', 'dehumanized' or 'disempowered' and from situations in which the 'rules' governing the expected health professional-patient relationships were broken. As such, the causes of dissatisfaction for this particular group of patients are similar to the causes of dissatisfaction with health care in general reported elsewhere. The palliative care approach emphasizes patient- and family-centred care and aims to promote physical and psychosocial well-being. The study findings suggest that adoption of the palliative care approach could reduce the experience of dissatisfaction for many service users, not only those whose deaths are anticipated.},

Background/rationale. Recent scholarship in the social sciences related to reproductive and imaging technologies and emergency resuscitation are examined and arguments are presented that question the appropriateness of a humanist view that emphasizes technology on the nonhuman and nonnatural side of a human/ nonhuman, nature/artifice divide. It is argued that what determines experiences such as dehumanization is not technology per se but how individual technologies are used and operate in specific user contexts, the meanings that are attributed to them, how individuals or cultural groups define what is human, and the organizational, human, political and economic technological system (technique) that creates rationale and efficient order within nursing, health care and society. Conclusion. The paper concludes by asking whether the commonplace appeal to resolve tensions between humane care and technology has erroneously highlighted technology as the reason for impersonal care, and encourages re-examination of the relationship(s) between technology, humane care and nursing practice.},

Affective organizational commitment (AOC) and affective commitment to patients (ACP) were tested as moderators. We also explored how nurses' humanity attributions to their in-group relate to stress symptoms. Participants were nurses working in different wards of an Italian urban hospital. Findings showed that perceiving patients as not fully human was related to lower levels of stress symptoms for nurses with high AOC and ACP, but not for nurses with low AOC and ACP. Moreover, for highly committed nurses, the attribution of uniquely human traits to the in-group was associated with increased stress symptoms. Implications of findings for the relationship between nurses and patients are discussed. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

It argues the need for reconciliation of presumed tension(s) between technology and person focused care and the need to reconsider our ways of understanding the relations between technology and nursing. Background/rationale. Recent scholarship in the social sciences related to reproductive and imaging technologies and emergency resuscitation are examined and arguments are presented that question the appropriateness of a humanist view that emphasizes technology on the nonhuman and nonnatural side of a human/ nonhuman, nature/artifice divide. It is argued that what determines experiences such as dehumanization is not technology per se but how individual technologies are used and operate in specific user contexts, the meanings that are attributed to them, how individuals or cultural groups define what is human, and the organizational, human, political and economic technological system (technique) that creates rationale and efficient order within nursing, health care and society. Conclusion. The paper concludes by asking whether the commonplace appeal to resolve tensions between humane care and technology has erroneously highlighted technology as the reason for impersonal care, and encourages re-examination of the relationship(s) between technology, humane care and nursing practice.},

	abstract = {Objective: Although the majority of hospital deaths occur in the intensive care unit and virtually all critically ill patients and their families have palliative needs, we know little about how patients and families, the most important "stakeholders," define high-quality intensive care unit palliative care. We conducted this study to obtain their views on important doMains of this care. Design: Qualitative study using focus groups facilitated by a single physician. Setting: A 20-bed general intensive care unit in a 382-bed community hospital in Oklahoma; 24-bed medical-surgical intensive care unit in a 377-bed tertiary, university hospital in urban California; and eight-bed medical intensive care unit in a 311-bed Veterans' Affairs hospital in a northeastern city. Patients: Randomly-selected patients with intensive care unit length of stay ≥5 days in 2007 to 2008 who survived the intensive care unit, families of survivors, and families of patients who died in the intensive care unit. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Focus group facilitator used open-ended questions and scripted probes from a written guide. Three investigators independently coded meeting transcripts, achieving consensus on themes. From 48 subjects (15 patients, 33 family members) in nine focus groups across three sites, a shared definition of high-quality intensive care unit palliative care emerged: timely, clear, and compassionate communication by clinicians; clinical decision-making focused on patients' preferences, goals, and values; patient care Maintaining comfort, dignity, and personhood; and family care with open access and proximity to patients, interdisciplinary support in the intensive care unit, and bereavement care for families of patients who died. Participants also endorsed specific processes to operationalize the care they considered important. Conclusions: Efforts to improve intensive care unit palliative care quality should focus on doMains and processes that are most valued by critically ill patients and their families, among whom we found broad agreement in a diverse sample. Measures of quality and effective interventions exist to improve care in doMains that are important to intensive care unit patients and families.

	abstract = {Objective: To explore older people's and their relatives' views on and experiences of acute health care. Design: Systematic procedures were used for study selection and data extraction and analysis. A comparative thematic approach to synthesis was taken with a number of features adopted from the literature on meta-ethnography. Data sources: Worldwide grey and published literature written in English between January 1999 and June 2008 identified from databases: CINAHL, Medline, British Nursing Index, EMBASE Psychiatry, International Bibliography of the Social Sciences, PsychINFO, and AgeInfo. Review methods: We conducted a systematic review and synthesis of qualitative studies describing older patients' and/or their relatives' experiences of care in acute hospital settings. 42 primary studies and 1 systematic review met the inclusion criteria. Results: A number of themes emerged. The quality of technical care is often taken for granted by older patients, and good or bad experiences are described more in terms of relational aspects of care. Older patients in hospital may feel worthless, fearful or not in control of what happens, especially if they have impaired cognition, or communication difficulties. Three key features of care consistently mediated these negative feelings and were linked to more positive experiences: "creating communities: connect with me", "maintaining identity: see who I am" and "sharing decision-making: include me". Conclusion: These findings highlight the perspectives of older people and their relatives on the delivery of personalized and dignified care in acute settings. They lend support to previous calls for relationship-centred approaches to care and provide a useful experience-based framework for practice for those involved in care for older people. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Aim: This study actively involved older people, staff and relatives in agreeing a definition of compassionate relationship-centred care and identifying strategies to promote such care in acute hospital settings for older people. It was a major component of a three year programme (the Leadership in Compassionate Care Programme, LCCP) seeking to integrate compassionate care across practice and educational environments. Background: Compassionate caring and promoting dignity are key priorities for policy, practice and research worldwide, being central to the quality of care for patients and families, and job satisfaction for staff. Therapeutic relationships are essential to achieving excellence in care but little is known about how to develop and sustain such relationships in a culture that increasingly focuses on throughput and rapid turnover. Approach and methods: The study used appreciative inquiry and a range of methods including participant observation, interviews, story telling and group discussions to actively engage older people, relatives and staff. A process of immersion crystallization was used to analyze data with staff as co-analysts. Findings: The study adds considerably to the conceptualization of compassionate, relationship-centred care and provides a model to aid staff deliver such care in practice, based on '. appreciative caring conversations' that enable all parties to gain two forms of 'person and relational knowledge' about '. who people are and what matters to them' and '. how people feel about their experience'. Such knowledge enables staff, patients and carers to '. work together to shape the way things are done'. The study generated a model called the 7 'C's that captures in detail the factors necessary to promote '. appreciative caring conversations'. Conclusions and implications: The study demonstrates that engaging in '. appreciative caring conversations' promotes compassionate, relationship-centred care but that these conversations involve practitioners taking risks. Such 'relational practices' must therefore be valued and accorded status. Staff require appropriate support, facilitation and strong leadership if these practices are to flourish. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Objective: The study investigated the meaning of patient dignity, threats to patients' dignity, and how patient dignity can be promoted, in acute hospital settings. Design: A qualitative, triangulated single case study design (one acute hospital), with embedded cases (one ward and its staff, and 24 patients). Setting: The study was based on a 22-bedded surgical ward in an acute hospital in England. Participants: Twenty-four patients, aged 34-92 years were purposively selected. There were 15 men and 9 women of varied socio-economic backgrounds. They could all communicate verbally and speak English. Twelve patients, who had stayed in the ward at least 2 days, were interviewed following discharge. The other 12 patients were observed and interviewed on the ward. The ward-based staff (26 registered nurses and healthcare assistants) were observed in practice. 13 were interviewed following observation. Six senior nurses were purposively selected for interviews. Methods: The data were collected during 2005. The Local Research Ethics Committee gave approval. Unstructured interviews using topic guides were conducted with the 24 patients, 13 ward-based staff and 6 senior nurses. Twelve 4-h episodes of participant observation were conducted. The data were analysed thematically using the framework approach. Findings: Patient dignity comprised feelings (feeling comfortable, in control and valued), physical presentation and behaviour. The environment, staff behaviour and patient factors impacted on patient dignity. Lack of environmental privacy threatened dignity. A conducive physical environment, dignity-promoting culture and other patients' support promoted dignity. Staff being curt, authoritarian and breaching privacy threatened dignity. Staff promoted dignity by providing privacy and interactions which made patients feel comfortable, in control and valued. Patients' impaired health and older age rendered them vulnerable to a loss of dignity. Patients promoted their own dignity through their attitudes (rationalisation, use of humour, acceptance), developing relationships with staff and retaining ability and control. Conclusion: Patients are vulnerable to loss of dignity in hospital. Staff behaviour and the hospital environment can influence whether patients' dignity is lost or upheld. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The study found that the characteristics nurses associated with dignity were many and varied. Important elements in the meaning the nurses ascribed to the notion of patient dignity were the elements of respect, privacy, control, advocacy and time. The themes which emerged from the patient interviews were similar to those which emerged from the interviews with nurses. The characteristics that patients attributed to dignity and its maintenance included respect, privacy, control, choice, humour and matter-of-factness. © Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.},

These two values appear to be inextricably linked. Aristotle's doctrine of the mean enables nurses to reflect on the appropriate degree of respect for the dignity of others and of respect for themselves. To develop an understanding of the rationale for and the significance and implications of dignity in health care practice, a view of human nature is proposed that implies vulnerability and fallibility, and that urges that an ethic of aspiration is embraced.

We propose a theoretical model and research agenda to overcome this limitation and to improve our understanding of dehumanization's experience in psychiatry, with a special focus on alcohol-related disorders. We also propose much-needed clinical avenues to reduce dehumanization in clinical contexts, centrally by (1) improving dehumanization awareness among medical workers; (2) reducing the need for healthcare workers to use dehumanization to alleviate professional exhaustion; and (3) optimizing medical training to increase empathy toward patients. Finally, some additional improvements are proposed to promote patient's choices, comfort, dignity, and ultimately humanity in hospitals. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	shorttitle = {Providing a "good death"},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Providing appropriate end-of-life care has become a primary concern of nurses and the public. The highly technological critical care environment may not facilitate such care. OBJECTIVE: To collect suggestions from critical care nurses for improving end-of-life care in intensive care units. METHODS: A geographically dispersed, random sample of 1409 members of the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses was sent a 72-item survey on perceptions of end-of life care. The survey included a request for suggestions on ways to improve end-of life care. RESULTS: Of the 861 critical care nurses who responded to the survey, 485 offered 530 suggestions for improving end-of-life care. Providing a "good death" was the major theme; specific suggestions included ways to help ensure death with dignity and peace. Barriers to providing good deaths included nursing time constraints, staffing patterns, communication challenges, and treatment decisions that were based on physicians' rather than patients' needs. Suggestions for providing a good death included facilitating dying with dignity; not allowing patients to be alone while dying; managing patients' pain and discomfort; knowing, and then following, patients' wishes for end-of-life care; promoting earlier cessation of treatment or not initiating aggressive treatment at all; and communicating effectively as a health-care team. Educational initiatives for professionals and the public were also suggested. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of specific suggestions provided by experienced critical care nurses might increase the quality of end-of-life care, facilitating a good death for intensive care patients.},

Nursing majors at a university (n = 96) and adults with a background in nursing (n = 95) were asked to write about their own death, someone they know who has experienced decline and challenges during old age, or dental pain (control). They then rated themselves, other nurses, and an older adult on uniquely human traits, uniquely human emotions, and compassion. Regardless of experimental condition, participants attributed the older adult less uniquely human traits and emotions compared to other nurses. Compared to nursing professionals with more experience, nursing students were more likely to rate the older adult as lower in uniquely human traits (intellectual, rational, shallow), whereas they rated other nurses as higher in uniquely human traits.

Study 2 replicates that powerful people dehumanize an outgroup more and shows that this is especially likely after making a tough decision that is painful for that outgroup. Study 3 replicates this in a medical context. Together, these studies show that dehumanization—although by itself a very negative phenomenon—can also have functional elements: it helps powerful people to make tough decisions in a more distant, cold, and rational manner.},

The purpose of this study was to assess the outcomes of manipulation following total knee arthroplasty.
        Methods: One hundred and thirteen knees in ninety patients underwent manipulation for postoperative flexion of ≤90° at a mean of ten weeks after surgery. Flexion was measured with a goniometer prior to total knee arthroplasty, at the conclusion of the operative procedure, before manipulation, immediately after manipulation, at six months, and at one, three, and five years postoperatively.
        Results: Eighty-one (90\%) of the ninety patients achieved improvement of ultimate knee flexion following manipulation. The average flexion was 102° prior to total knee arthroplasty, 111° following skin closure, and 70° before manipulation. The average improvement in flexion from the measurement made before manipulation to that recorded at the five-year follow-up was 35° (p {\textless} 0.0001, paired t test). There was no significant difference in the mean improvement in flexion when patients who had manipulation within twelve weeks postoperatively were compared with those who had manipulation more than twelve weeks postoperatively. Patients who eventually underwent manipulation had significantly lower preoperative Knee Society pain scores (more pain) than those who had not had manipulation (p = 0.0027).
        Conclusions: Manipulation generally increases ultimate flexion following total knee arthroplasty. Patients with severe preoperative pain are more likely to require manipulation.

	abstract = {Bandholm T, Kehlet H. Physiotherapy exercise after fast-track total hip and knee arthroplasty: time for reconsideration? Major surgery, including total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA), is followed by a convalescence period, during which the loss of muscle strength and function is considerable, especially early after surgery. In recent years, a combination of unimodal evidence-based perioperative care components has been demonstrated to enhance recovery, with decreased need for hospitalization, convalescence, and risk of medical complications after major surgery—the fast-track methodology or enhanced recovery programs. It is the nature of this methodology to systematically and scientifically optimize all perioperative care components, with the overall goal of enhancing recovery. This is also the case for the care component “physiotherapy exercise” after THA and TKA. The 2 latest meta-analyses on the effectiveness of physiotherapy exercise after THA and TKA generally conclude that physiotherapy exercise after THA and TKA either does not work or is not very effective. The reason for this may be that the “pill” of physiotherapy exercise typically offered after THA and TKA does not contain the right active ingredients (too little intensity) or is offered at the wrong time (too late after surgery). We propose changing the focus to earlier initiated and more intensive physiotherapy exercise after THA and TKA (fast-track physiotherapy exercise), to reduce the early loss of muscle strength and function after surgery. Ideally, the physiotherapy exercise interventions after THA and TKA should be simple, using few and well-chosen exercises that are described in detail, adhering to basic exercise physiology principles, if possible.},

	abstract = {Purpose
To evaluate the utility of femoral nerve blocks in postoperative pain control after hip arthroscopy.
Methods
Forty consecutive patients scheduled for hip arthroscopy were randomized into 2 groups for postoperative pain control. Half were to receive routine intravenous narcotics for pain scores of 7 or above in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), and the other half were to receive a femoral nerve block in the PACU for the same pain scores. Data were compared with respect to patient sex, patient age, traction times, type of procedure, nausea, overall patient satisfaction with analgesia, and duration of time in the PACU.
Results
Thirty-six patients had initial pain scores of 7 of 10 or greater on a visual analog scale. Of these patients, 16 were randomized to receive postoperative morphine and 20 to receive a femoral nerve block. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups with respect to sex, age, traction times, or type of procedure performed. Patients who received morphine had a significantly longer time to discharge from the PACU (216 minutes) than the femoral nerve block group (177 minutes). The morphine group was also significantly more likely to report postoperative nausea (75\%) than the femoral nerve block group (10\%). Patients receiving femoral nerve blocks were significantly more likely to be satisfied with their postoperative pain control (90\%) than those who had received morphine (25\%). All of the patients receiving a femoral nerve block stated that they would undergo the block again if they needed another hip arthroscopy.
Conclusions
On the basis of all criteria studied (quality of pain relief, length of stay in the PACU, side effects, and patient satisfaction), a femoral nerve block is an excellent alternative to routine narcotic pain medication in patients undergoing hip arthroscopy.

We therefore conducted a randomized, controlled trial. Patients and methods In this randomized controlled trial we compared the effect of tranexamic acid and fibrin spray on blood loss in cemented total hip arthroplasty. 66 patients were randomized to 1 of 3 parallel groups receiving (1) a 10 mg/kg bolus of tranexamic acid prior to surgery, (2) 10 mL of fibrin spray during surgery, or (3) neither. All participants except the surgeon were blinded as to treatment group until data analysis was complete. Blood loss was calculated from preoperative and postoperative hematocrit. Results Neither active treatment was found to be superior to the other in terms of overall blood loss. Losses were lower than those in the control group, when using either tranexamic acid (22\% lower, p = 0.02) or fibrin spray (32\% lower, p = 0.02). Interpretation We found that the use of tranexamic acid at induction, or topical fibrin spray intraoperatively, reduced blood loss compared to the control group.

	abstract = {Background: The use of closed-suction drainage systems after total joint replacement is a common practice. The theoretical advantages for the use of drains is a reduction in the occurrence of wound hematomas and infection. The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine, on the basis of the evidence from randomized controlled trials, the advantages and adverse effects of surgical drains.
        Methods: All randomized trials, as far as we know, that compared patients managed with closed-suction drainage systems and those managed without a drain following elective hip and knee arthroplasty were considered. The trials were identified with use of searches of the Cochrane Collaboration with no restriction on languages or source. Two authors independently extracted the data, and the methods of all identified trials were assessed.
        Results: Eighteen studies involving 3495 patients with 3689 wounds were included in the analysis. The pooled results indicated that there was no significant difference between the wounds treated with a drain and those treated without a drain with respect to the occurrence of wound infection (relative risk, 0.73; 95\% confidence interval, 0.47 to 1.14), wound hematoma (relative risk, 1.73; 95\% confidence interval, 0.74 to 4.07), or reoperations for wound complications (relative risk, 0.52; 95\% confidence interval, 0.13 to 1.99). A drained wound was associated with a significantly greater need for transfusion (relative risk, 1.43; 95\% confidence interval, 1.19 to 1.72). Reinforcement of wound dressings was required more frequently in the group managed without drains. No difference between the groups was seen with respect to limb-swelling, venous thrombosis, or hospital stay.
        Conclusions: Studies to date have indicated that closed suction drainage increases the transfusion requirements after elective hip and knee arthroplasty and has no major benefits. Further randomized trials with use of larger numbers of patients with full reporting of outcomes are indicated before the absence of any benefit, particularly for the outcome of wound infection, can be proved.

It is an extension of the critical pathway that integrates modalities in surgery, anesthesia, and nutrition, enforces early mobilization and feeding, and emphasizes reduction of the surgical stress response. It entails a great partnership between a surgeon and an anesthesiologist with several other specialists to form a multi-disciplinary team, which may then engage in patient care. The practice of fast-track surgery has yielded excellent results and there has been a significant reduction in hospital stay without a rise in complications or re-admissions. The effective implementation begins with the formulation of a protocol, carrying out each intervention and gathering outcome data. The care of a patient is divided into three phases: Before, during, and after surgery. Each stage needs active participation of few or all the members of the multi-disciplinary team. Other than surgical technique, anesthetic drugs, and techniques form the cornerstone in the ability of the surgeon to carry out a fast-track surgery safely. It is also the role of this team to keep abreast with the latest development in fast-track methodology and make appropriate changes to policy. In the Indian healthcare system, there is a huge benefit that may be achieved by the successful implementation of a fast-track surgery program at an institutional level. The lack of awareness regarding this concept, fear and apprehension regarding its implementation are the main barriers that need to be overcome.},

	url = {https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2993037/},
	abstract = {Background
The goal of this study was to assess whether patients receive their antibiotic prophylaxis as prescribed. We also investigated what doses and durations of antibiotics are typically ordered, which patients actually receive antibiotics and factors causing the ordered antibiotic regimen to be altered.

Methods
We performed a retrospective review of 205 patient charts and sent a national survey to all surgeon members of the Canadian Orthopaedic Trauma Society (COTS) about antibiotic prophylaxis in the setting of surgical treatment for closed fractures.

Results
In all, 93\% (179 of 193) of patients received an appropriate preoperative dose of antibiotics, whereas less than 32\% (58 of 181) of patients received their postoperative antibiotics as ordered. The most commonly stated reason for patients not receiving their postoperative antibiotics as ordered was patients being discharged before completing 3 postoperative doses. There was a 70\% (39 of 56) response rate to the survey sent to COTS surgeons. A single dose of a first-generation cephalosporin preoperatively followed by 3 doses postoperatively is the most common practice among orthopedic trauma surgeons across Canada, but several surgeons give only preoperative prophylaxis.

Conclusion
Adherence to multidose postoperative antibiotic regimens is poor. Meta-analyses have failed to demonstrate the superiority of multidose regimens over single-dose prophylaxis. Single-dose preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis may be a reasonable choice for most orthopedic trauma patients with closed fractures.},

	abstract = {Hip fracture resulting from a fall from standing height or lower in people with osteoporosis or osteopenia (fragility fracture) is a major, growing health problem associated with population ageing. It has an annual UK incidence of 70-75 000, with a medical and social care cost of about £2bn (€2.3bn; \$3.3bn),1 and one month and one year mortality of about 10\% and 30\% respectively2 (usually resulting from comorbidity rather than from the fracture itself). A comprehensive multidisciplinary approach, avoidance of delay, and continuity of management are needed from presentation to follow-up, including after transition from hospital back into the community. 

This article summarises the most recent recommendations from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) on the management of hip fracture.3 The recommendations are for all adults but are based on surgical, anaesthetic, and orthogeriatric evidence and expertise acquired among older patients (the group in whom hip fracture is most common). Prevention of hip fracture is covered by other NICE guidance (on falls4 and osteoporosis5 6). 

NICE recommendations are based on systematic reviews of best available evidence and explicit consideration of cost effectiveness. When minimal evidence is available, recommendations are based on the Guideline Development Group’s experience and opinion of what constitutes good practice. Evidence levels for the recommendations are given in italic in square brackets.

	abstract = {Background: Given the well recognized imperative to treat hip fractures as expeditiously as possible there can arise uncertainty regarding the balance between pre-operative medical optimization and delay of surgery. Echocardiography is often felt to considerably delay surgery with limited change to patient management.
        Methods: We retrospectively reviewed forty-nine consecutive patients who had echocardiography prior to surgery for hip fracture and compared them to fifty-eight patients who did not have echocardiography.
        Results: We found that those who had echocardiography were more likely to have medication changes (51.02\% vs. 6.9\%) but were unlikely to require angiography, bypass or valvular surgery prior to fracture fixation. Those undergoing echo had a longer time to surgery-3.30 days (SD=2.49) while those in the control group waited 1.5 days (SD=1.29), (p=0.005). Rates of spinal anaesthesia were similar in both groups.
        Conclusions: We feel that these results confirm the theory that echocardiography, as currently provided, significantly delays surgery for hip fracture and that this may negatively affect patient outcomes.},

	abstract = {A proximal femoral or hip fracture is the most common reason for admission to an acute orthopaedic ward. About 86 000 such fractures occur each year in the United Kingdom.w1 Global numbers were reported as 1.3 million in 1990, and depending on secular trends could be 7-21 million by 2050.1

In developed countries, the treatment of a hip fracture requires a wide range of disciplines, as the patient will present to the ambulance service and the accident and emergency unit, then pass through departments of radiology, anaesthetics, orthopaedic surgery, medicine, and rehabilitation. Medical and social services in the community may be needed when the patient leaves hospital.

Mortality associated with a hip fracture is about 5-10\% after one month. One year after fracture about a third of patients will have died, compared with an expected annual mortality of about 10\% in this age group.2 3 w2 Thus, only a third of deaths are directly attributable to the hip fracture itself, but patients and relatives often think that the fracture has played a crucial part in the final illness.w2

More than 10\% of survivors will be unable to return to their previous residence. Most of the remainder will have some residual pain or disability.2 3

The musculoskeletal Cochrane review group has identified all randomised controlled trials on hip fractures and most are summarised in Cochrane reviews (http://www.cochrane.org/) and in Clinical Evidence articles.4

For aspects of hip fracture that cannot or have not been subject to randomised controlled trials, we looked at systematic review articles, the evidence based guidelines identified on this topic, and our personal libraries of hip fracture references based on annual Medline searches.5–7

The average age of patients with hip fracture is over 80, and nearly 80\% are women.2 …},

	abstract = {Hip fracture is one of the most common orthopedic conditions and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. With a progressively aging population, the annual incidence of hip fracture is expected to increase substantially. Emerging evidence suggests that early surgery ({\textless}24 h) minimizes complications secondary to immobilization, including orthostatic pneumonia and venous thromboembolism. Delayed surgical repair ({\textgreater}48 h) has been consistently demonstrated to be associated with an increased risk of 30-day and 1-year mortality. Nonetheless, early surgery necessitates a shorter time for preoperative medical preparation, in particular cardiac assessment. Patients who undergo emergent orthopedic surgery are therefore at greater risk of perioperative cardiac events than those who undergo elective surgery. In addition, the prompt triage system for preoperative cardiac assessment not only identifies patients at high risk of perioperative cardiac complications but also reduces unnecessary cardiac consultations for low-risk patients. We review the current recommendations for preoperative cardiac assessment adapted for patients with hip fracture and describe our current triage system for preoperative cardiac consultation.},

	abstract = {Background: Guidelines exist for the surgical treatment of hip fracture, but the effect of early surgery on mortality and other outcomes that are important for patients remains unclear. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the effect of early surgery on the risk of death and common postoperative complications among elderly patients with hip fracture.
Methods: We searched electronic databases (including MEDLINE and EMBASE), the archives of meetings of orthopedic associations and the bibliographies of relevant articles and questioned experts to identify prospective studies, published in any language, that evaluated the effects of early surgery in patients undergoing procedures for hip fracture. Two reviewers independently assessed methodologic quality and extracted relevant data. We pooled data by means of the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model, which is based on the inverse variance method.
Results: We identified 1939 citations, of which 16 observational studies met our inclusion criteria. These studies had a total of 13 478 patients for whom mortality data were complete (1764 total deaths). Based on the five studies that reported adjusted risk of death (4208 patients, 721 deaths), irrespective of the cut-off for delay (24, 48 or 72 hours), earlier surgery (i.e., within the cut-off time) was associated with a significant reduction in mortality (relative risk [RR] 0.81, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.68–0.96, p = 0.01). Unadjusted data indicated that earlier surgery also reduced in-hospital pneumonia (RR 0.59, 95\% CI 0.37–0.93, p = 0.02) and pressure sores (RR 0.48, 95\% CI 0.34–0.69, p {\textless} 0.001).
Interpretation: Earlier surgery was associated with a lower risk of death and lower rates of postoperative pneumonia and pressure sores among elderly patients with hip fracture. These results suggest that reducing delays may reduce mortality and complications.},

The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of established international and Australian statewide HAI surveillance programs and recommend a pathway for the development of a national HAI surveillance program in Australia.
METHODS: This study examined existing HAI surveillance programs through a literature review, a review of HAI surveillance program documentation, such as websites, surveillance manuals and data reports and direct contact with program representatives.
RESULTS: Evidence from international programs demonstrates national HAI surveillance reduces the incidence of HAIs. However, the current status of HAI surveillance activity in Australian states is disparate, variation between programs is not well understood, and the quality of data currently used to compose national HAI rates is uncertain.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a need to develop a well-structured, evidence-based national HAI program in Australia to meet the increasing demand for validated reliable national HAI data. Such a program could be leveraged off the work of existing Australian and international programs.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION
Hip fracture poses a significant global challenge both to healthcare systems and to patients themselves. We outline the management of this injury, highlight areas where the evidence is deficient and discuss research efforts towards improving the quality of the evidence base.


SOURCES OF DATA
We searched MEDLINE, PubMed and the Cochrane Library, using the core search terms 'hip fracture' and 'proximal femoral fracture'. In addition we reviewed national treatment guidelines for hip fracture care and references from relevant articles. Only articles published in English from inception to March 2015 were included.


AREAS OF AGREEMENT
Modern hip fracture management should consist of a coordinated multidisciplinary approach with orthogeriatrician input, early surgery, adequate analgesia and liaison with related services to facilitate safe supported discharge.


AREAS OF CONTROVERSY
The optimum thromboprophylaxis to reduce venous thromboembolism remains a topic for debate. The use of bone cement has received much attention recently with concerns about its safety in the frailest of hip fracture patients.


GROWING POINTS
An increasing understanding of the severity and impact of sustaining a hip fracture upon quality of life.


AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH
Strategies to improve postoperative mobility, postoperative nutrition and the role of home-based rehabilitation. There is a need to identify the optimum analgesic regimes and assessment tools for hip fracture patients with cognitive impairment.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, fracture surgery represents a big part of the orthopedic surgeon workload, and usually has associated major clinical and social cost implications. These fractures have several complications. Some of these are medical, and other related to the surgical treatment itself. Medical complications may affect around 20\% of patients with hip fracture. Cognitive and neurological alterations, cardiopulmonary affections (alone or combined), venous thromboembolism, gastrointestinal tract bleeding, urinary tract complications, perioperative anemia, electrolytic and metabolic disorders, and pressure scars are the most important medical complications after hip surgery in terms of frequency, increase of length of stay and perioperative mortality. Complications arising from hip fracture surgery are fairly common, and vary depending on whether the fracture is intracapsular or extracapsular. The main problems in intracapsular fractures are biological: vascularization of the femoral head, and lack of periosteum -a major contributor to fracture healing- in the femoral neck. In extracapsular fractures, by contrast, the problem is mechanical, and relates to load-bearing. Early surgical fixation, the role of anti-thromboembolic and anti-infective prophylaxis, good pain control at the perioperative, detection and management of delirium, correct urinary tract management, avoidance of malnutrition, vitamin D supplementation, osteoporosis treatment and advancement of early mobilization to improve functional recovery and falls prevention are basic recommendations for an optimal maintenance of hip fractured patients.},

Upon admission to the study, vital signs such as blood pressure, mean blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR) and pain-intensity measurements [using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)] were obtained and repeated at 15 min, 2 h and at8 h. The occurrence of complications was registered. One hundred seventy-five patients were randomized, and 21 were excluded from participation. The remaining 154 patients were grouped as: group A (n = 62) or group B (n = 92). The mean pain level on admission to the ED for all patients, assessed with the VAS, was 8.21 ± 0.91 (CI 95\%: 6.43–9.99); in group A the VAS was 7.6 ± 0.22 and in group B 8.5 ± 0.72 (p = 0.411). At 15-min evaluation, values were: group A 6.24 ± 0.17 and group B 2.9 ± 0.16 (p {\textless} 0.001). At the 2-h assessment, values were: group A 1.78 ± 0.11 and group B 2.3 ± 1.16 (p = 0.764). At 8 h the VAS for group A was 2.03 ± 0.12 and for group B 4.4 ± 0.91 (p = 0.083). This study demonstrates that: (1) parenteral NSAIDs are very effective as analgesics after hip fractures in elderly patients, (2) fascia-iliaca regional blocks are nearly as effective for up to about 8 h after administration and (3) regional fascia-iliaca blocks effectively control post-hip fracture pain. (4) Fascia iliaca regional block has a rapid onset.},

	abstract = {Fast-track surgery, or enhanced recovery, has appeared in the last 20 years or so as a combination of the optimisation of clinical protocols ans organisational processes, pursuing the reduction in surgical stress with the aim of reducing peri-operative comorbidities, convalescence time, and functional recovery, resulting in a reduction in admission time. After a review of the European literature available on this subject, this article attempts to present an update. It highlights its interest and origins, basically being set out as a response to the question: ‘Why is this patient in Hospital today?’ It also attempts to summarise the essence of such programmes the search for immediate post-surgical mobilisation, being supported by a multidisciplinary approach. This includes a multimodal intervention and analgesia a limitation in the use of opiates, and the active participation by the patients in their own recovery. Furthermore, mention is made of the initiatives by European State organisation as a boost to enhanced recovery programmes in their respective countries, as is the case in Denmark, France, and the United Kingdom. The clinical outcomes published up to September 2015 have been reviewed. A subsequent decrease in mean hospital stay is observed in 11 studies, achieving patient satisfaction, low complication rates, a reduction in the transfusion rates, and with no apparent increase in re-admissions. Mention is also made of the financial consequences, and how to implement these programmes. As a conclusion, an analysis is made of the future challenges of fast-track surgery, such as the possibility of moving towards outpatient surgery or the obtaining of a surgery ‘with no risk or pain’ in general, for which there are still open lines of work.
Resumen
La cirugía de recuperación rápida, o fast-track, aparece en las últimas décadas como una combinación de optimización de procesos organizativos y clínicos, persiguiendo la atenuación del estrés quirúrgico con el fin de reducir las comorbilidades perioperatorias y el tiempo de convalecencia y de recuperación funcional, resultando en una reducción del tiempo de hospitalización. Tras la revisión de la literatura europea disponible sobre el tema, el artículo pretende realizar una actualización, poniendo de relieve su interés y orígenes, básicamente planteándose como una respuesta a la pregunta: «¿Por qué está el paciente en el hospital hoy?», e intentando resumir la esencia de este tipo de programas: buscar la movilización posquirúrgica inmediata apoyándose en un enfoque multidisciplinar, una intervención y analgesia multimodales, una limitación en el uso de opiáceos y una participación activa del paciente en su propia recuperación. Asimismo, se mencionan las iniciativas de organismos estatales europeos como fomento a programas de recuperación rápida en sus respectivos países, como es el caso en Dinamarca, Francia y el Reino Unido. Se han revisado los resultados clínicos publicados hasta el mes de septiembre de 2015, observando en 11 estudios una reducción consecuente de la estancia media, consiguiendo la satisfacción de los pacientes, unas tasas de complicaciones bajas y una reducción de la tasa de transfusiones, sin que aparezca un aumento de los reingresos. Se mencionan también las consecuencias económicas y la forma de implementar tales proyectos. Como conclusión, se analizan los retos futuros de la cirugía fast-track, como puede ser el posible planteamiento hacia una cirugía ambulatoria, o de forma más general la obtención de una cirugía «sin dolor ni riesgo», existiendo para ello todavía líneas de trabajo abiertas.},

	doi = {10.3310/hta1120},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES. To review the available evidence on the value of routine preoperative testing in healthy or asymptomatic adults. To assess the completeness of existing reviews of preoperative testing and how applicable their conclusions are to the UK. To identify areas for further research. HOW THE RESEARCH WAS CONDUCTED. The databases Medline, Embase, Biological Abstracts, Science Citation Index and HealthSTAR were thoroughly searched for relevant articles which were then classified and appraised. The databases of the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (DARE and NHS Economic Evaluations Database) and the Cochrane Collaboration (the Cochrane Library) were also used to verify the completeness of the search. In this review, 'routine' tests are defined as those ordered for an asymptomatic, apparently healthy individual in the absence of any specific clinical indication, to identify conditions undetected by clinical history and examination. RESEARCH FINDINGS. No controlled trials of the value of the following routine preoperative tests have been published. All available evidence reports the results of case-series. CHEST X-RAY. Few studies allow the outcome of routine chest X-rays to be distinguished from those of indicated chest X-rays, and fewer have gone beyond abnormality yields to examine the impact on clinical management. Findings from routine preoperative chest X-ray are reported as abnormal in 2.5-37.0\% of cases, and lead to a change in clinical management in 0-2.1\% of patients. The effect on patient outcomes is unknown. Both abnormality yield and impact on patient management rise with age and poorer American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) status. The limited evidence on the value of a chest X-ray as a baseline measure suggests that it will be of value in less than 9\% of patients. ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHY. The findings from routine preoperative electrocardiograms (ECGs) are abnormal in 4.6-31.7\% of cases, and lead to a change of management in 0-2.2\% of patients. The effect on patient outcomes is unknown. The proportion of abnormal tests rises with age and worsening ASA status. The predictive power of preoperative ECGs for postoperative cardiac complications in non-cardiopulmonary surgery is weak. There is no evidence to support the value of recording a preoperative ECG as a 'baseline.' HAEMOGLOBIN MEASUREMENT AND BLOOD COUNTS. Routine preoperative measurement shows that the haemoglobin level may be lower than 10-10.5 g/dl in up to 5\% of patients, but that it is rarely lower than 9 g/dl. The routine test leads to a change of management in 0.1\% to 2.7\% of patients. Routine preoperative measurement shows that the platelet count is abnormally low in less than 1.1\% of patients, and that platelet count results rarely if ever lead to change in management of patients. Routine preoperative white blood cell count is abnormal in less than 1\% of patients, and rarely if ever leads to change in management of patients. TESTS OF HAEMOSTASIS. Abnormalities of bleeding time, prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are found in up to 3.8\%, 4.8\% and 15.6\% of routine preoperative tests, respectively. The results of these tests very rarely lead to change in the clinical management of patients. BIOCHEMISTRY. In routine preoperative tests of serum biochemistry, abnormal levels of sodium or potassium are found in up to 1.4\% of patients, and abnormal levels of urea or creatinine are found in up to 2.5\% of patients. Abnormal levels of glucose are found in up to 5.2\% of patients. These abnormalities rarely lead to change in clinical management of patients. URINE TESTING. Routine preoperative urinalysis finds abnormal results in 1-34.1\% of patients, and leads to a change of management in 0.1-2.8\% of patients. The only abnormality that leads to a change in management of patients is the finding of white blood cells in the urine. There is no good evidence that preoperative abnormal urinalysis is associated with any postoperative complication in non-urinary tract surgery. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)},

	abstract = {Aims and objectives. To define the core elements of perioperative nursing. Background. To measure the nursing care intensity in operating departments and day surgery units, a consensus on the content of perioperative nursing is required. The core elements of perioperative nursing were initially defined based on literature and the clinical expertise of the national workgroup. Suggested core elements were verified in this study. Because healthcare systems constantly suffer from limited resources, while patients are legitimated and ethically justified good nursing care, it is essential to produce reliable information for resource allocation. Design. Descriptive survey using Delphi technique. Methods. The purposeful sample of 55 experts was invited to participate in the Delphi panel to evaluate the suggested core elements of perioperative nursing. Two nationwide Delphi rounds were conducted. The response rates were 89\% and 49\%, respectively. Content Validity Index was calculated for each component. Results. The Delphi panel accepted the suggested core elements that were seen describing the core of perioperative nursing. Conclusion. The initially defined core elements of perioperative nursing were verified in this study, with the core elements describing patient’s safety as crucial in perioperative nursing. Those concerning patients’ needs of information, communication with significant others, patients’ coping mechanisms and mental well-being or administrating basic care – for example hygiene – were not seen to be as fundamental as those describing physiological needs. Relevance to clinical practice. The results of this study can be used as an initial step when constructing an instrument for measuring the nursing care intensity in perioperative settings. In the future, the instrument may provide objective evidence of nursing care intensity and thus facilitate resource allocation. A further significance of this study lies in its potential to make perioperative nursing visible, so the nursing outcomes may be evaluated and proved.},

Contemporary perioperative care is a truly multidisciplinary endeavour with implications for cancer-specific outcomes. Methods: A literature review was performed querying PubMed and the Cochrane Library for articles published between 1966 to 2012 on specific perioperative interventions with the potential to improve the outcomes of surgical oncology patients. Keywords used were: fast-track, enhanced recovery, accelerated rehabilitation, multimodal and perioperative care. Specific interventions included normothermia, hyperoxygenation, surgical-site infection, skin preparation, transfusion, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, thromboembolism and antibiotic prophylaxis, laparoscopy, radiotherapy, perioperative steroids and monoclonal antibodies. Included articles had to be randomized controlled trials, prospective or nationwide series, or systematic reviews/meta-analyses, published in English, French or German. Results: Important elements of modern perioperative care that improve recovery of patients and outcomes in surgical oncology include accelerated recovery pathways, thromboembolism and antibiotic prophylaxis, hyperoxygenation, maintenance of normothermia, avoidance of blood transfusion and cautious use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, promotion of laparoscopic surgery, chlorhexidine–alcohol skin preparation and multidisciplinary meetings to determine multimodal therapy.

	doi = {10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2018.06.020},
	abstract = {Background
Opioid overdose deaths in North America have been rising largely as a result of fentanyl adulteration in the illegal drug supply. Drug checking is an established harm reduction intervention in some European settings but has not been broadly implemented or evaluated in North America. We are evaluating a pilot program offering drug checking for people who use street drugs in Vancouver, British Columbia.
Methods
Drug checking services were implemented at two locations in Vancouver between November 2017 and April 2018 using a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer and fentanyl immunoassay strips. We report on the findings generated by this technological combination during the study period.
Results
During the study period, a total of 1714 samples were tested. Of 907 samples expected to be heroin, only 160 (17.6\%) contained the expected substance, and 822 (90.6\%) tested positive for fentanyl. Of 256 samples expected to be speed or crystal meth, 225 (87.9\%) contained amphetamine or methamphetamine, and 15 (5.9\%) tested positive for fentanyl. The FTIR also found unexpected and potentially dangerous substances and adulterants other than fentanyl.
Conclusions
This pilot program has demonstrated the feasibility of drug checking for identifying individual drug samples containing unexpected or hazardous substances, including fentanyl. By identifying the range of adulterants and diluents and giving an estimate of their prevalence in different drug types, it has also provided information about the composition of the illicit drug supply in an urban North American setting.},

HIV prevalence is elevated in prison and this is due to the over representation of people who inject drugs (PWID). Yet HIV prevention programs for PWID are scarce in the prison setting. With a high proportion of drug users and few prevention programs, HIV transmission occurs and sometimes at an alarming rate. This commentary focuses primarily on drug users in prison; their risk behaviours and levels of infection. It also comments on the transmission of HIV including outbreaks and the efforts to prevent transmission within the prison setting. The spread of HIV in prison has substantial public health implications as virtually all prisoners return to the community. HIV prevention and treatment strategies known to be effective in community settings, such as methadone maintenance treatment, needle and syringe programs, condoms and antiretroviral therapy should be provided to prisoners as a matter of urgency.},

	abstract = {Through comparative socio-historical analysis of American school-based drug education, this review critically examines past perspectives and practices and how they shaped current pro grams. Among the key findings emerging from this analysis: Contrary to the popular belief that drug education began in the 1960s, its roots actually go back at least 115 years to the advent of compulsory temperance tnstruction. Although the particular substances targeted by such ap proaches have changed, the underlying approaches and dominant "no-substance-use" injunc tion has not. Despite the existence of "informed choice" approaches, throughout much of this period, evaluation efforts continue to be constrained by the limited dictates of "no-use" perspectives. A pragmatic alternative to contemporary "Just Say No" education is offered that strives to minimize potential harm resulting from the uninformed misuse of licit and illicit substances. A unique evaluative strategy designed to assess the effectiveness of thts form of "informed choice" or "harm reduction" drug education is discussed.},

	abstract = {Traditionally the doping debate has been dominated by those who want to see doping forbidden (the prohibitionist view) and those who want to see it permitted (the ban abolitionist view).
In this article, the authors analyse a third position starting from the assertion that doping use is a symptom of the paradigm of highly competitive elite sports, in the same way as addictions reflect current social paradigms in wider society. Based upon a conceptual distinction between occasional use, habitual use and addiction, and focusing on the physical and/or mental dependency caused by the addictive use of a certain drug, we argue that marihuana, stimulants and anabolic steroid abuse—the most frequently detected substances in doping tests—satisfies at least one, often both, of these conditions.
A conclusion to be drawn from the authors' arguments is that the prohibitionist view is inappropriate for dealing with doping, as the severe sanctions attached to it will cut the doper off her/his social and professional environment, thereby risking reinforcing her/his addictive conduct. But the ban abolitionist view seems inappropriate as well. At first sight, it seems neither rational nor humane not to intervene when confronted with conduct which is highly harmful for the individual and upon which she has reduced or no control whatsoever.
Instead the authors' proposal will be to contextualise dopers' conduct within sport healthcare and see it strictly in relation to each athlete's personal background. Developing preventive programmes—implemented through person-tailored counselling and eventually treatment, rather than severe sanctions or the mere lifting of the ban—seems to be a more reasonable, and probably more efficient, way of conducting ‘the war against doping’.},

	abstract = {Aims
A universal Internet-based preventive intervention has been shown to reduce alcohol and cannabis use. The aim of this study was to examine if this program could also reduce risk-factors associated with substance use in adolescents.
Method
A cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted in Sydney, Australia in 2007–2008 to assess the effectiveness of the Internet-based Climate Schools: Alcohol and Cannabis course. The evidence-based course, aimed at reducing alcohol and cannabis use, consists of two sets of six lessons delivered approximately six months apart. A total of 764 students (mean 13.1years) from 10 secondary schools were randomly allocated to receive the preventive intervention (n=397, five schools), or their usual health classes (n=367, five schools) over the year. Participants were assessed at baseline, immediately post, and six and twelve months following the intervention on their levels of truancy, psychological distress and moral disengagement.
Results
Compared to the control group, students in the intervention group showed significant reductions in truancy, psychological distress and moral disengagement up to twelve months following completion of the intervention.
Conclusions
These intervention effects indicate that Internet-based preventive interventions designed to prevent alcohol and cannabis use can concurrently reduce risk-factors associated with substance use in adolescents.

Concurrently, adolescents face an increasingly demanding environment, which results in heightened vulnerability to injury. In this paper, we provide an overview of developmental considerations for adolescent injury interventions based on developmental science, including findings from behavioural neuroscience and psychology. We examine the role that typical developmental processes play in the way adolescents perceive and respond to risk and how this integrated body of developmental research adds to our understanding of how to do injury prevention with adolescents. We then highlight strategies to improve the translation of developmental research into adolescent injury prevention practice, calling on examples of existing interventions including graduated driver licensing.},

	abstract = {This article provides a new reading of the crossover between youth subculture and drug consumption, and seeks to demonstrate that drug prohibition has entered a legitimation crisis in social and political policy (Habermas, 1975). This article argues that contemporary drug normalisation is at the centre of the apparent failure of drug prohibition to understand and respond to the growth in oppositional messages derived from digital communication and the use of drug representations by mainstream capitalism to sell everyday commodities for profit. At the same time, UK and US newspapers have questioned the validity of the ‘war on drugs’ owing to political corruption and human rights abuses in Mexico, Afghanistan and Colombia. The article considers that drug normalisation has disrupted drug policy because intoxicants have become incorporated into everyday culture, and in particular youth subculture. Within the recent literature, young people's drug use has been theorised within a generalised framework of postmodernity. This article argues that drug normalisation theory is not a postmodern concept. It is a theory derived from the work of the Chicago School articulated by Alfred Lindesmith, Howard Becker and David Matza, who in turn influenced the UK National Deviance Conference and the subsequent CCCS theory of subculture. This created the theoretical opportunity to interpret substance consumption as a condition of normalisation separate from crime.},

	abstract = {Issues. To reduce the occurrence and costs related to substance use and associated harms it is important to intervene early. Although a number of international school-based prevention programs exist, the majority show minimal effects in reducing drug use and related harms. Given the emphasis on early intervention and prevention in Australia, it is timely to review the programs currently trialled in Australian schools. This paper reports the type and efficacy of Australian school-based prevention programs for alcohol and other drugs. Approach. Cochrane, PsychInfo and PubMed databases were searched. Additional materials were obtained from authors, websites and reference lists. Studies were selected if they described programs developed and trialled in Australia that address prevention of alcohol and other drug use in schools. Key Findings. Eight trials of seven intervention programs were identified. The programs targeted alcohol, cannabis and tobacco and most were based on social learning principles. All were universal. Five of the seven intervention programs achieved reductions in alcohol, cannabis and tobacco use at follow up. Conclusion. Existing school-based prevention programs have shown to be efficacious in the Australian context. However, there are only a few programs available, and these require further evaluative research. This is critical, given that substance use is such a significant public health problem. The findings challenge the commonly held view that school-based prevention programs are not effective.[Teesson M, Newton NC, Barrett EL.

	abstract = {Aim Substance use by young people has long been a concern of western society, but opinion is mixed as to which prevention approach offers the greatest benefit, and whether indeed there is any benefit at all. This paper reviews the nature of prevention programmes, the research evidence that underpins these programmes and the prevention objectives against which effectiveness is measured. The aim of this is to create better understanding of the elements that maximize programme effectiveness, what can be achieved by prevention programmes and how programmes can be improved. Findings There is a range of prevention approaches for which there is evidence of effectiveness. Some are classroom-based; some focus upon parenting; some have substantial whole-of-school and community elements; and some target risk and protective factors in early childhood. All, however, are based substantially on the social influence model. In an attempt to improve practice lists of effective programmes have been developed, but there are concerns about the science behind selection. On balance, there is consistent evidence that social influence prevention programmes do have a small, positive effect on drug use, but this then raises the question as to whether harm, rather than use, would be the more worthwhile target for prevention. Prevention that seeks to reduce harm has been demonstrably effective, but has found little support in some jurisdictions. Conclusion Research has created a progressively better understanding of how to optimize programme effectiveness and what can be achieved realistically by even the most effective programmes. However, further research is required to identify which, if any, particular approach offers greater promise. The effectiveness of harm reduction should be compared with more traditional abstinence and the additional effects of whole of school, parent and community elements need to be measured more accurately. Contemporary social influence prevention programmes are flawed, but the approach is still the best way of influencing drug use behaviour in young people as a whole. Evidence-based refinement is the best option for greater benefit.},
